# FreeCodeCamp - API Projects - Timestamp Microservice
API project required for the Back End Development Certification of freeCodeCamp(https://www.freecodecamp.com/)

**User Stories:**
* I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)
* If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
* If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties..

**Example Usage:**
* http://rlisboars-api-timestamp.herokuapp.com/May%2022,%202017 
* http://rlisboars-api-timestamp.herokuapp.com/1495422000000
